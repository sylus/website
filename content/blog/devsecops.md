## Artifactory

* Package Search in a Universal Repository (name, tag, digest, wildcards)
* Supports majority of most common programming languages (TIOBE)
* PHP
  * PHP Composer support / proxy and manage all packagist
  * Host your internal packages and index files on private PHP Composer repositories
* C/C++
  * Support conan C/C++ packae manager
  * Complete suite for management / distribution of binaries
  * Close relationship to creator of conan
  * Tight integration with visual studio
* CRAN / R
  * Supports R packages using CRAN repositories
  * Full control of deployment and resolution process of R packages
  * Secure and Local Repositories
  * Proxy Remote CRAN resources and cache downloaded R packages
  * View R package metadata
  * Deploy R sources and binaries directly in the UI
  * Version management allowing to keep older versions of the packages
  * Cross Zone Sharing enhancements
* Docker
  * Ability to promote and copy images from one repo to another in CI/CD
  * Different access privileges depending on the CI/CD peipeline
  * Artifactory will scan all major package formats that are leveraged inside container
  * Build information includes all layers including base layers, as well as dependencies
* Maven
  * Resolves longstanding issues with Maven
    * Project aggregation may lead to inconsistent deployment
    * Context matters with enhanced metadata for every build
    * Deployment flexibility and ability to run at different stages
    * Keep your POM file tidy
    * Cycle Time is too long
    * Binaries and their build pipelines should be decoupled
* CI/CD
  * Support all major CI's GitLab, Jenkins, VSTS, etc
  * Collect exhaustive build information from builds
  * Bill of Materials stored in artifactory
  * Best practices for working with Docker in a CI Pipeline
* Kubernetes
  * First class integration with Azure (AKS, ACS) etc
  * Many demos showing a full CI/CD workflow
    * Build a Java app using Gradle
    * Get base image with all dependencies
    * Get a product ready Docker image thatâ€™s ready to deploy
    * Generate a Helm chart for the build with the specific build numbers needed to deploy it
    * Pushed out to ACR and Deploy to AKS
  * Helm
    * Helm chart resolution to resolve and aggregate deps
    * Control domains for search and resolution of artifacts
    * Easy access to multiple repostiories
    * Secure and private repositories with multiple layers of fine grained access controls
    * Seperate your stable and incubator repositories
    * Use SemVer2 versioning in your charts
* Supports stricter requirements with airgap solutions (no network, one-way connection)

* Key Benefits:
  * Reliable Access: Overcome network issues restricting you from being able to download / update packages.
  * Optimized Build Process: Manage resource sharing within your organization to eliminate unnecessary network traffic.
  * Full Support for Docker: Support all Docker Registry APIs providing security features needed by enterprise Docker users.
  * Secure Solution: Enable controlled access through secure private PHP Composer repositories.
  * Smart Search and Artifactory Query Language (AQL): Find the packages you need using advanced search tools
  * Distribution and Sharing: Enable efficient distribution of proprietary packages to give developers access to the same package version, resolve dependencies, and seamlessly share proprietary code regardless of physical location.
  * Maintenance and Monitoring: Keep an organized managed system with automatic, timed cleanup processes, eliminating old artifacts.
  * Universal, End-to-End Solution: Developers use multiple protocols, build tools, packaging formats, and CI systems as part of software development, integration, and distribution processes.

## X-Ray

* Block the download of artifacts for which Xray has detected security vulnerabilities.
* Can manually set tiers to manually approve whether to release the artifact for download or not
* You can detect security vulnerabilities, performance issues across your application
* Be more reactive from the beginning of development always knowing the security of your application
* Xray is triggered to run a scan, and if any issues are detected, DevSec staff can get notified
* Issues graded via a severity level that you control and set custom alters for
* Clear messages given to developers through Rest API / UI
* X-Ray can show you all the licenses used in all indexed artifact
* Define watches to report on banned licenses being used in a project
* Docker
  * Reduce security risk running large swatch of containers often based on open source
  * All layers of an image will be scanned including the base layer
  * Don't let applications with exploitable vulnerabilities slip undetected in pipeline
  * Aqua integration with X-Ray provides end-to-end solution for securing containerized apps
  * Continous image assurance makes it possible to enforce image usage policies throughout the pipeline
  * Ensure only containers that are scanned and pass tests are allowed to be used
* CI/CD
  * Automatically fail a CI build job if it uploaded a build with vulnerabilities to Artifactory

## Migrating from Nexus

* Migrate from Nexus using nexus2art migrator tool
* Friendly wizard like interface for transferring data
* Data can include instance repositories, artifacts, users, and settings
* Migrator is intelligent enough to validate all naming conventions and repo types
* Any kind of validation failure will be highlighted
* Below is the current full feature-set of nexus2art:
  * Migrate users, groups, and privileges
  * Migrate scheduled tasks
  * Migrate other instance-wide settings
  * Support paid Nexus features, such as custom metadata
  * Modify virtual repository child lists
  * Modify repository package types
  * Remove the dependency on the JFrog CLI
  * Obfuscate passwords in save files
* Case Study move to Artifactory OpenMRS

Dev Part of DevSecOps (Secure DevOps)

1) GitLab
2) Jenkins
3) Actors
4) How to maintain it
5) What releases like build / deploy
6) Syscon for each component and how this particular component behaves
