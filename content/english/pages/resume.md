## Education

### Honors, Bachelor of Computer Science, Carleton University
// September 2006 – August 2010 <br>
// Minor in Psychology

I graduated from the Computer Science program at Carleton University, specializing in software and computing. Throughout my studies, I focused on two key areas: human-computer interaction and software engineering. Notably, my Honors project was carried out in the HCI lab, where I developed a mobile app using Cordova that delivered an engaging narrative-based geolocative storyline. Additionally, I found great interest in courses such as Computer Graphics and Programming Paradigms, which further enriched my academic experience.

### Game Development, Algonquin College
// September 2004 - June 2006

Completed two out of three years in the game development program at Algonquin College, before I made the decision to transfer into the Bachelor of Computer Science program at Carleton University. During my studies, I delved into diverse subjects such as DirectX, OpenGL, and Object-Oriented Programming with C++, while engaging in captivating projects that involved developing various games. One of the notable projects was the creation and rendering of a chessboard, encompassing all associated rulesets.
